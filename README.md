Angular refs (refrences) 
like in other frameworks Reactjs, Vuejs Refs are used to excess a particular HTML elemnent present in the DOM...

Refs are set using '#' 

There is a disadvantage of using refs that it can not directly be used in typescript code it has to be passed into the typescript file threw a event or some kind of binding....

we will later improve this advantage while using a replacement for Refs that is called @ViewChild....

check the code for more info....
